# Getting Started with tic-tac-toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` - webpack will watch for changes deploy the latest ones to browser

### `npm run build` - run to build the code for production

### `npm run eject` - once you eject you can't go back, read more about it [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)

This is a very simple app/game that will help you to get familiar with React.
We will add more features to it as we go, you're welcome to suggest improvments and open issues in this repo.
